# RPC Scavenger Hunt

These exercises require a synced mainnet full node with the transaction index
active (`-txindex=1`). Chaincode Labs can provide credentials to a hosted node
with an authenticated [proxy](https://github.com/pinheadmz/rpc-auth-proxy)
so students can complete the exercises using `bitcoin-cli` locally but without
needing to sync a full node themselves. To use the proxy you must have `bitcoin-cli`
installed. It is part of the package you can download from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/).
These packages obviously include the Bitcoin Core daemon as well, but you do not
need to run it or sync a mainnet node yourself for this exercise.
